And then I woke up...
> Ahh... What happened..? Where am I?

... I stood up from the chair and when I looked left, I saw some red stains on the metal drawers. To the right was some kind of machine connected to the chair. _„Pretty large piece of technology, I wonder what is it’s purpose.“_ The whole floor was messy and I could see the red stains again. _„I need answers, maybe I should go look outside.“_ I went through the doors in front of me and appeared in a long curved hall which contained nothing, but the doors I just came through. _„Where now, huh?“_ There were no markings to help me decide where to go, so I just went to the left and hoped it would get me somewhere. As I was walking, I’ve noticed something written on my right arm. It read **„Wanderer_10_3B9AC9FF“**. _„Hmm... What could that mean?“_ I thought to myself, but kept walking, thinking I could get some answers somewhere else than here. After about a minute of walking, I finally found something... Another doors, same as before... The only difference was that they were on the opposite side of the wall. I also noticed a few little dots on the doors, they kinda looked like some form of Braille, but I couldn’t recognize what it meant. I finally opened the door and what I saw was astonishing...

_„ANOTHER LONG CURVED HALL AND THIS TIME EVEN LONGER THAN BEFORE!? Like are you f\*\*king serious? WHO DID THIS?! Also what’s up with those dots on the doors, huh? Why would anyone need some dots on the doors, that lead to the SAME room as the one you just were in! Holy sh\*\* this is retarded...“_ Anyways... After I calmed my mind and went through the now about 1 and half minute long hall. 
NOW when I arrived at some doors, I insantly opened them and didn’t wait, because I was still a bit pissed from the last time. _„Well what do we have here? ANOTHER HALL????!!!!!“_ No, ok, I am just kidding, there was no hall anymore, that would have been quite boring and unfunny for the story. What I saw was actually really amazing. 

## Chapter 1: The Adventure Begins
A village full of PUPPIES AND KITTENS! Can you imagine that?! It was a feeling as if I was in a heaven or something! I walked to what I thought was the main house, along the way accompanied by the doggies and kitties. I noticed that all the dogs were waving their tails the same way and in the same intervals, but I didn’t really think about it too much. The house was fairly large considering it was a village of puppies and kittens. It was made out of steel, same as every other house in the village, the only difference being it’s size. I also noticed that it had the same doors as the ones before and with the dots too, although this time, the dots were of different sizes and places on the doors. I opened the door and saw a walking metal machine doing some work.
> „Hello, stranger“

it said in a monotone voice as it turned it’s head on me while still doing it’s work. _„Hi,“_ I said, _„what is this place? And who...“ „I am **Leader_14D42**, mayor of **Village_Cuteness**. Can I help you?“ „Oh, so that’s why the city is called like that, hehe... - I am **Leader_14D42**, mayor of **Village_Cuteness**. Can I help you?“ „Hmm... Why did it reapeat itself?“_ I told myself in the head. _„Why are there puppies and kittens everywhere?“_  
_„I am **Leader_14D42**, mayor of **Village_Cuteness**. Can I help you?“ „This is so weird,“_ I said quitely, _„SIT!“ „I didn’t understand. Reapeat.“_ Firstly, I didn’t know why he didn’t understand me, I said it quite loud and well articulated, but then something hit me in the head... IT WAS AN IDEA! HAHAAAA! _„Sit.“ „Invalid order, was not programmed to do this action.“_ It was very interesting, but funny at the same time. _„Work.“ „Already in process.“ „Oh wow, so this is an actual order he understands!“_ I said to myself. _„Stop.“ „Your current rank cannot give orders.“ „Well then I guess I am just not gonna waste time in here, can’t get any answers from you so you’re useless to me.“_ Before I left, I saw a notebook and a pen on a table by the doors. I thought it would be useful so I took it with me. 

When I left the house, I didn’t know why, but I felt great. I felt the happieness pumping through me and I didn’t really want to stay here anymore, I wanted to explore. And so I did! I took the nearest road out of the village and walked... I was suddenly surrounded by the beauty of the nature, crystal clear river on the right, beautiful green forest on the left, I didn’t know where to look first. After some time of walking, I thought to myself _„Why am I walking? Isn’t this too slow? I have enjoyed the nature enough, now the walking part is just boring and wasting my time...“_ and so I started running. Still slow... Let’s go faster. A bit faster! Even faster! I didn’t have any physical limits which felt great, but at the same time for some reason it didn’t feel right. This didn’t stop me though. The speed felt so good I just kept going faster and at one point I was even pushing holes into the ground under me. 

After few minutes of mindlessly running, I came across a little fellow holding 2 puppies and walking towards the city I just came from. _„Where are you going, little guy?“_ He didn’t reply. I asked again the same question, but he didn’t seem to react in any way. _„Hmm... Maybe he is deaf? No, he had to see that I was talking to him... He could be blind and deaf, but how can he walk all by himself?“_ It didn’t make much sense to me, the only answer I could come up with was that he was actually ignoring me for some reason, but still... It felt very weird and I was confused. _„This has to have some explanation.“_ I thought. Anyway... I turned away from the guy and suddenly I saw a large city in front of me. It was all metallic, no trees, no grass, nothing... Just iron and steel. I felt as if I just teleported here suddenly. I turned back around and saw nothing but dead ground and trees. Far back I could also see some buildings looking like nuclear reactors. It was a nightmare, I was scared and in shock. _„What happened? How did I get here?!“_ I suddenly felt something touching my back, I turned around and nothing was there, just the massive city. I started hearing whispers in my head. _„Fiiiind yourselfffff, fiiiind meeee... that is the ooooonly way you can truuuuuly be freeeeeeee... Or truuuly dieeee?“_ OooOOOoooOoOO spooky! Sorry, I didn’t know how else to make it scary... Now that I read it back, it kinda sounds funny and not scary... WELL, WHAT CAN I DO NOW. Anyway, it was really terrifying. I stood there, frozen, thinking about what could it mean. _„Why? WHY did it happen? Who even am I?...“_ After some time, I managed to pull myself up and think clearly again. I decided to go to the city. Walking in, I saw many walking machines just like the one from the first village. All of them working, not even noticing me. 

The houses were also the same as the ones from before, it’s as if nothing has changed, but the village from before at least had some nature in it, this one just looks like a pile of scrap. Every machine had a writing on it, very similar to the one I have on my right arm. There were also some buildings that had the dots from before on them. It’s like they were some sort of names of the buildings... _„Maybe I could find out somewhere what these dots mean.“_ I started walking through the city, looking around for someone or something that could help me. After few minutes of walking, I came across a large steel gate with a guard in front of it and the damned dots, now on his chest. Fairly large machine it was and the words are coming from me. I measure 197 cm, but this guy? Holy sh\*\*, he was 2.0304568527918781725888324873096 times higher than me! Amazing... Well anyways... I came up to him and without me saying anything, he said _„Password.“_ And so I replied _„G fog yurselv, figgit.“_ And he replied _„Incorrect password.“_ HAHAHA, GET IT?! HAHAHA, HE WASN’T EVEN OFFENDED, BECAUSE HE IS A MACHINE PROGRAMMED TO DO ONE THING ONLY, HAHAHA, HA, HA.. HA..ha..a...aaaok shut up. At that point, I didn’t know how to feel... I felt powerful, because I could tell anyone basically anything and they couldn’t be offended, but I also felt lost in the world, because I didn’t know if there was anybody who could even understand me. So far, I had emotions, they didn’t... It was getting dark, so I had to find a place to sleep at. I realized that I could basically sleep wherever I wanted, because not only the machines could not be upset about anything, but also machines don’t need to sleep. They are powered by electricity. I walked into some random house and layed down on a bed without any duvet, but I didn’t feel cold.

I never felt cold, neither hot. I closed my eyes, letting my thoughts flow through my head. Thinking about being alone, I said _„If I am alone, then what is the point of me living?“_ I didn’t answer it and just fell asleep.
