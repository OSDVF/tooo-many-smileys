**The legend says his high intelligence gives him power to read other people‚Äôs minds, making him able to manipulate others like it‚Äôs nothing**. It also says that he‚Äôs handsome and he has a crush on a girl every 5 months or so. The girl is different every time, so this gives him some variety into his life. Yea, so I basically just told you the legend, but who believes in legends in 21st century, am I right? Haha, yea‚Ä¶ Especially the ones that I just made up to start the story. This story is about a boy who sees the world and society in different perspective than others. His name is‚Ä¶ Well‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs call him Pheonix, because I don‚Äôt want to spoil everything for you right from the beggining. At the time of me writing this, he is 16 years old. 16 years, 8 months, 22 days and 4 hours to be exact, but we will be watching him grow up from the age of 6.

6 years old, oh what a wonderful baby. This baby had dreams. Dreams so big and phenomenal, that he didn‚Äôt want to wake up to school ‚Äì ‚ÄûMOOOOOOOM! LET ME SLEEP, I DON‚ÄôT WANNA GO TO SCHOOL TODAY‚Äú he said‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. Actually he didn‚Äôt say this, he said something more like ‚ÄûMoam, no skull plees‚Äú. Sorry that was unnecessary, I just wanted to translate his thoughts. Ok so moving on, he did his morning stuff everybody does in the morning, like peeing, brushing teeth with unwashed hands after peeing and masturbating. Off to school he goes, in his way he‚Äôs not really looking in front of him, he just watches the ground the whole way, thinking about life and what he‚Äôs going to do that day. The trip to school was nothing special, so I‚Äôll just skip that. When he finally arrives to the school his pulse rate raises and he starts to sweat a little. He sees all the sexy 7 ‚Äì 8 year old girls in front of him with their huge sexy butts and tops-ok I am kidding, I wasn‚Äôt like that when I was-wait I meant HE! HE wasn‚Äôt like that when HE was 6, hehe. He wasn‚Äôt really looking after girls much, he was more of a wierd IT type guy that nobody liked. Anyway, let‚Äôs continue. So he went into his classroom, settled on his chair and that‚Äôs it. He did nothing else, just sat on his tight school chair, watching and listening to the teacher‚Äôs blah blah blah every day of that school year. Ok let‚Äôs skip some time with this NEW TIME MACHINE that I just bought last week, OH YEA HERE WE GO! WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!  
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! WEEEEEUAWEEEUAWEEEEUAWEEEEEU  
AWEEEEWAUWIIAUWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!! HOLY JESUS MAKARONI WITH MEATBALLS did you see that? I bet you didn‚Äôt HAHA, HAHAHA no. Wait, let me‚Ä¶ Ehh‚Ä¶ Let me try to ‚Äûdraw‚Äú this for you ok?

Ok, so you just saw me in the time machine, I am so pretty ahh‚Ä¶ Ok so now we are in the year of 2010 and our young Pheonix goes out with his friends. It‚Äôs sunny outside, summer. Pheonix is actually in love at the moment, he fell in love with one of his girl friends that he met through one of his other friends, who had left him after some time because he had to move to a different city, which sucks because he really appreciated that friend. Ok so Pheonix comes up to his girl friend‚Äôs balcony window and knocks on it. It was really close to the ground, so he could do that. She opens the door and comes out with her friend, who was also a friend of Pheonix at the time, so that‚Äôs fine. After some time of conversating about many different and very important topics, they‚Äôve come to a sensitive one. That topic was about their love, how one loves the other and the other loves the one wait what? Nice english dude‚Ä¶ Ok so they talk about that and then they, ehh, try to, ehh, kiss eachother‚Ä¶ EHH well‚Ä¶ EHH‚Ä¶ They are getting closer and closer, their eyes are almost closed. THEY‚ÄôRE LIKE 10 CENTIMETERS APART FROM EACHOTHER! OMG IT‚ÄôS COMING aaaaaand he says he can‚Äôt do it‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ Yep‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ Ehh‚Ä¶ So, that‚Äôs it. He didn‚Äôt feel wierd, he didn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs been a disappointment, no. He felt normal, he felt like they can do it sometimes later. Well‚Ä¶ He never kissed her. She left the town for a week, no contact or anything and then I DON‚ÄôT REMEMBER OMG WHAT A SHAME. My poor memory, I am too old for this shhhhhhhovel. Yes yes, shovel :)))). Ok so they eventually stop talking to each other because Pheonix‚Äôs brother tells him, that the girls are not worth it. He listens. Stops talking to them. Randomly. JUST LIKE THAT. 1 DAY, THEY ARE OUTSIDE PLAYING AND TALKING AND THEN THE OTHER DAY PHEONIX IGNORES HER. LIKE WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU PHEONIX. Ok so after that he stays home without friends for the next 5 years or so, he is really lonely, but he doesn‚Äôt care, he has his videogames and stuff‚Ä¶ Oh yea, videogames, I didn‚Äôt tell you about that‚Ä¶

You know what that means? OH YEA YOU DO! HAHA! Really? Do you? Because I don‚Äôt so would you please kindly tell me what I should do right now? Oh what do you say? Use the NEW TIME MACHINE to get back in time to the year 2006? Oh, yea‚Ä¶ Yea let‚Äôs do just that. OK READY??? HERE WE GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO yea no, I will stop with this time traveling noise. You‚Äôve already seen my beautiful face while time traveling, so there‚Äôs no need to ‚Äûdraw‚Äú it again.

So here we are‚Ä¶ In year 2006 AGAIN. Ok, so videogames‚Ä¶ It all started when Pheonix‚Äôs parents bought him and his brother a console, classic console that you would plug in to your TV and play many different videogames on it. This thing got him started with videogames, it was fun and everytime he was in kindergarten, he wanted to go home as quickly as he could to play some games with his brother. They played games such as Super Mario Bros., The Legends of Zelda and Mortal Kombat which was very popular at the time. Ok, so this was only the start of Pheonix‚Äôs HAPPY and NOTBORINGATALL life. His dad bought him a computer and, well, it was like an angel coming down from the heaven for little Pheonix. I remember exactly how happy he was when he saw that machine, that big white box of heavy metal components. Of course it wasn‚Äôt just the computer, we had the monitor too, but‚Ä¶ You know, I‚Ä¶ OK LIKE WHY WOULD I WRITE THAT WE ALSO HAD A MONITOR WITH IT? You would need to be an idiot to not know that computers need a monitor to do stuff on them. Like‚Ä¶ Ok whatever shut up I don‚Äôt like you (jk I love you ;) ). Wtf did I just write, ok so ANYWAYS, he got the computer and‚Ä¶ He was happy, yea I already told you that, why am I WRITING THIS AGAIN? OMG, THIS IS EMARASSING. Ok, I need to focus‚Ä¶ Basically, Pheonix was happy and he played a lot of games on that machine. A LOT. Like when I say a lot I mean too much, because he played for like 5 hours a day from 7 to 11 years old and then his brother bought himself a laptop, so Pheonix had the computer all for himself. That meant him playing for about 8 ‚Äì 10 hours a day. Every day. I know sounds crazy right? Well guess what‚Ä¶ He doesn‚Äôt regret any single minute of those thousands of hours he had played. Do you know why? No but really, try and guess why would he not regret playing games for such a long amount of time. I will even stop writing right now, so you will actually think about it.

Hey, are you done? If you are, then I will tell you why‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs because all of the experiences he gathered, because all of the people he met, skills he learned, stories he witnessed. One of the main reasons of him being able to speak english fluently are games. He learned most of his social skills through videogames. He learned to imagine, to think and overcome puzzles. To think for himself. He has gathered these and many more skills through just videogames. And of course you could tell that he would learn these things even if he didn‚Äôt play games and if he just went out to speak and connect with other people in real life. Yes, I could agree on this‚Ä¶ But he would be a completely different person than he is now and I am not sure if he would like to be that person. He met his best friend through a videogame. He chose his school thanks to videogames. If he didn‚Äôt play, he would just be an average person without any real friends, without any experiences and without any social skills. Just because he is an introvert and he had and has some trouble talking to people. Videogames helped him to connect with real world through the virtual world and he will always be thankful for that.

**20 years later** ‚Äì His back hurts. His spine is completely deformed. Look at him as he slowly walks through the streets, stepping on that little guy on the ground, because he can‚Äôt even see thanks to the VIDEOGAMES! Oh yea they are soo good‚Ä¶
HEHE.
