## The day I will never forget
It was a beautiful sunny day when I, 5 years old at the time, was playing on the playground in kindergarten with my fellow youngsters. Amongst them was a girl I liked and we were hanging out a lot, even though love wasn’t a very known emotion to us little peeps. 

After a while of us enjoying the weather and, we were called by the teachers for a cup of tea. They did this to keep us well hydrated throughout the day. When we arrived, all the kids were standing in a line for the yummy cup of tea. I was standing right behind her.

„Your hair stinks,“ I said. She didn’t reply, but I really thought her hair stinked, so I said it, don’t blame me. When we finished drinking our tea, they called us back into the main building. The last thing I remember is hearing one of the teachers say to the girl „Oh, did you make a poo poo?“

Musel jsem to sem dát 🤣
